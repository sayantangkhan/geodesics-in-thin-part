* Outline

What should the main theorems/constructions in the paper be?
- The weak convex core, and proof of how it's weak convex.
- Geodesics that spend an appreciable amount of time in the thin part are exponentially rare. Compare this to similar results for measures induced by random walks.
- Equality of lattice point entropy and net point entropy. Can think of this as a very weak version of ABEM, but proven without using dynamics.
- (Optional, might only be in thesis) Application to Patterson-Sullivan theory.
- (Appendix) HHS structure for non-orientable Teichm√ºller spaces.
