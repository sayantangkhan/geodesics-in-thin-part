{\color{red} Outline of introduction.}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item List similarities with IVGF surfaces, and point out where analogy breaks down.
\item State theorem about systole being weak convex.
\item Weak convexity lets us focus on systole, rather than entire space.
\item Can prove exponential rareness of thin geodesics in systole, using random walk methods.
\item Using this, we get stat-convex, and consequently, rest of PS theory thanks to others.
\item Hard part of random walk argument is showing hLP = hNP. We spend sections 5 and 6 doing this.
\item Sketch out idea of proof of hLP = hNP.
\item Mention what's in the appendix.
\end{enumerate}
