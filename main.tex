\begin{abstract}
  We show that a finite volume deformation retract $\systole(\no_g)/\mcg(\no_g)$ of the moduli space of non-orientable surface $\mo(\no_g)$ behaves like the convex core of $\mo(\no_g)$, despite not even being quasi-convex.
  We then show that geodesics in the convex core leave compact regions with exponentially low probabilities, showing that the action of $\mcg(\no_g)$ on $\systole(\no_g)$ is \emph{statistically convex-cocompact}.
  In combination with recent results of Coulon, Gekhtman, Ma, Tapie, and Yang, this leads to the construction of Patterson-Sullivan measures on the limit set, and a finite geodesic flow invariant measure for moduli spaces of non-orientable surfaces, with respect to which the geodesic flow is mixing.
  A key step of our proof relies on \emph{complexity length}, developed by Dowdall and Masur, which is an alternative metric on Teichmüller space that can accounts for geodesics that spend a considerable fraction of their time in the thin part.
